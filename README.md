Favorite Top Ten Website
We created a website that goes over both of our top ten anime with video reviews after each reason we have that anime at that ranking.

Peer Review: Amazing looking website, I love the color theme you and your partner chose. I also like how you used linear gradiant on most of the headers it gives your website a unique look. Responsiveness works extremely well until you get below 660px. I like your landing page and hero image, it gets right to the point. Image and videos are displayed neetly, one thing I would recommend. Since it looks like most of your text are all aligned on the left, add some indentation so it doesn't look like it's in a column. On your figma, Desktop Home page, Aidan's Pick isn't linked to anything. Other than that, spacing looks amazing and website looks like it was built by a UI/UX designer!
