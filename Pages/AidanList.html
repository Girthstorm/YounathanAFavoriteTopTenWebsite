    <!-- Start MHA -->
    <h2>1. <span class="MHA">My Hero Academia</span></h2>
    <p>My Hero Academia is great because it has so much action, is constantly changing and evolving, has a really nice art design and great cast of characters. I have followed this anime for many years so I may be biased but I love the attention to detail, no filler, and some of the amazing animation during some battles. For example, during the My Hero Academia: Two Heroes movie, the animators put a lot of detail into the final boss battle and it really upped the amount of hype during those scenes. That's why it is currently my number one.</p>

    <h2>2. <span class="JJBA">Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure</span></h2>
    <p>This was tough deciding if Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure should be second or first on my list. This show has so much character, a huge array of characters with all unique personalities, and the constant threat of DIO that makes the buildup of this show so amazing. Every part feels like a new show with a new cast and it is always refreshing. The art style is so unique and the color palletes are never dull, plus all the references to song, artists, and films make this a show for those who love pop-culture. The only reason this is not number one is because of the shows part one being on the more boring side, thats not to say its not an integral part of the show. It is the basis of the entire show so I still greatly appreciate it. Thats why this is in second. </p>

    <h2>3. <span class="CSM">Chainsaw Man</span></h2>
    <p>Chainsaw Man is truly a breath of fresh air. This show is unhinged and raw. No holding back when it comes to villains and nobody is a “good guy” or “bad guy”. Everything comes with a shroud of eerie and mystery due to the fact there is little to no background on most of the characters. You never know what is behind the down the hall until you get to it. In this case, literally. The character development in this show is wonderfully done, its not done by doing long, drawn out flashbacks, it’s done quickly and efficiently, you learn more about the character through there words, actions, appearance, and I guess the short 10 second flashbacks. Most character building and development is done in the present, which is a wonderful change from the long standing 4 episode backstories, One Piece. To say this is a good anime is an understatement. Go read the manga, as this gets animated, it will surely go up the list and you’ll see why.</p>

    <h2>4. <span class="OP">One Piece</span></h2>
    <p>While I may be late to the game with this one and still early on, I preemptively put One Piece at number four purely because I am excited for what the later episodes turn out to be. That is not to say One Piece is boring right now(currently on episode 164) but at some points it can feel very drawn out. That doesnt make it bad so to say, but instead it makes it seem like an endurence test. That is because up until episode 206, the anime starts to really show its age. The animation style is very dated, the fights are kinda stiff and slow with nothing really crazy like I have seen clips of in the later seasons. That being said, I see the hype around it and am really excited to watch the later episodes and am really loving this series so far and I can definately see this going up in the list as time goes on. Thanks to Chris an Ken for putting me onto one piece.</p>

    <!-- Start JJK -->
    <h2>5. <span class="JJK">JUJUTSU KAISEN</span></h2>
    <p>JJK is an absolutely amazing show with great animation, character design, and an interesting power system. I really appreciate how all powers in the show are interlinked in some way and that you can actually learn about them instead of just, “Oh hey, he can fly because he said so”. It’s really nice to see a power system where nothing is too hidden. I also love the character dynamics, its really reminiscent of Denji, Power, and Hayakawa from chainsaw man(or the other way around, still works), where Yuji, Nobara, and Megumi kind of exactly are the same. I guess that’s why I love this anime so much, also the cool animation moments and how cool Gojo is. Other than that this is a solid anime with an exciting plot that has many twists and turn, I would definitely recommend.</p>

    <!-- Start Hori -->
    <h2>6. <span class="Hori">Horimiya</span></h2>
    <p>To say that this is one of the only good romance anime’s is an understatement. Most other romance anime's build up to this lame grand finale of the two main character’s building up to a lame kiss where that’s the end of the story. That’s bland and boring. Horimiya should be the rule for romance anime's, not the exception. We actually get to see the relationship between Hori and Miyamura develop and take place. They have struggles and actually show what their relationship entails, not just some happily ever after, the end, type of deal. That being said. This anime is also different because is focuses on the side character’s romance too which I love to see. Its so refreshing to see an actual romance in this category.</p>

    <!-- Start Toni -->
    <h2>7. <span class="Toni">Tonikawa</span></h2>
    <p>Tonikawa is another romance anime that gets into the relationship at the start and shows behind the scenes and the actual relationship at hand. This is another great anime like Horimiya that stands out from the romance genre and is amazing. The only issue is that this anime is pushing the physical aspect of love a little too much and lacks a focus on personality but other than that it has a killer opening song. I highly recommend checking it out.</p>

    <h2>8. <span class="FMAB">Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood</span></h2>
    <p>Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece. I have no gripes with this whatsoever. You might be thinking then, “why isn’t this higher then?” Well that’s because while I have no gripes, I just believe that it isn't the best in my opinion, while it is a masterpiece I dont believe it to be THE masterpiece. It has great characters, a good variety of enemies, and im kinda a sucker for romance so I definitely enjoy the bit of romance near the end, it was defiantly a good ending. Just wish there was more.</p>

    <h2>9. <span class="LS">Lucky Star</span></h2>
    <p>Lucky Star was the first anime I have ever watched when I was younger. To say that this holds a special place in my heart is an understatement. This show is pure nostalgia for me. From the opening, to the characters.  This anime was my introduction to anime and im glad I found it. The story was nice and funny, I had a blast watching it and im satisfied with the show and still go back to listen to the opening song every once in a while and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes slice of life. Lucky Star is old but gold.</p>

    <h2>10. <span class="MLS">MY love STORY!!</span></h2>
    <p>To finish off this list is another romance anime, sorry, im a sucker for good romance(not Twilight).  My love story is the ultimate feel good anime. There has not been an anime that has made me genuinely feel so happy in my life. This is a story of an unlikely couple between a girl and a big guy who everyone avoid but is really a big softie, what isn’t there to love about this. It’s pure bliss to see the relationship between Takeo and Rinko develop. It’s and unlikely couple with a beautiful story and it’s definitely a feel good anime. Even if you don’t like romance I think you should give it a shot, hey we all gave the Cowboy Bebop live action a shot.</p>
